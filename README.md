# Big Data Analytics Technology 

Bello Earthlings! I am learning big data analytics technologies in my Computer Science Masters Course with National University of Singapore (NUS). 
I will like to share the knowledge I have learnt in the course, as such I have created this respository. I target to update it bi-weekly as I learnt new materials from my class! 

Sincerely hope this is helpful, and welcome any suggestions to make this respository more useful üòç
